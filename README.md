# NodeJSwithExpress

### Mastering Nodejs

<p>
Structure to facilitate Unit Testing, Functional Testing, Integration. It is not necessary to start the tests using port 3100 to perform the tests in <strong> app.js </strong> using the server.</p>

### Using simtax ES7

<p>Using ES6 JavaScript.</p>

```
yarn add sucrase
```

<p>Create a new file <strong> nodemon.js </strong> Then register the sucrase as follows. We are saying that every file with extension <strong> JS </strong> will run with node and make a record in sucrase.</p>

```javascript
{
  "execMap": {
    "js": "node -r sucrase/register"
  }
}

```

<p>To debug it is necessary to make some changes.</p>
<strong>package.json</strong>.

```javascript
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/server.js",
    "dev:debug": "nodemon --inspect src/server.js"
  },
```

<p>If using vscode use the following configuration.</p>
<p><strong>launch.json</strong> Just remember that the file can be accessed by vscode debugging.</p>

```javascript
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "protocol": "inspector"
    }
  ]
```

<p>For debug, restart every time with some change and only pass the following property.</p>

```javascript
"restart": true,
```

after changes in debugging, run the command
```
yarn dev:debug
```
